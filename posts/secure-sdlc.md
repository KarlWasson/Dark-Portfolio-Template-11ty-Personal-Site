A cybersecurity company engaged my thought-leadership copywriting services to write a blog about securing the software development lifecycle. The article was pitched to media outlets and picked up by [Venture Beat](https://venturebeat.com/).

The project involved interviewing the VP of products and working together to craft thought-provoking content for decision-makers and leaders interested in DevSecOps.

### Thought-Leadership Article Writing Process

As the copywriter, the first step was understanding and researching current best practices for securing the website development lifecycle. As a former web developer and security enthusiast, I have a readily available list of resources. The second step was interviewing the  Vice President of Product at a well-respected, industrial cybersecurity company. I asked questions about the reality of securing the software development lifecycle and the challenges posed during the process.

After the interview, I identified a hook for the blog post that gave it a unique angle and enhanced the storytelling element to appeal to our target audience. This article was picked up by a major publisher, raising the profile of the VP and company.
