### Blog Article Writing Process

As the copywriter, the first step was understanding and researching current best practices for securing the website development lifecycle. As a form web developer and security enthusiast, I have a readily available list of resources available. The second step was interviewing the product VP at a major industrial cybersecurity company. I asked questions about the reality of securing the software development lifecycle and the challenges posed during the process.

After the interview, I identified a hook for the blog post that gave it a unique angle and enhanced the storytelling element to appeal to our target audience. This article was picked up by a major publisher, raising the profile of the VP.
