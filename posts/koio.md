Highend sneaker brand Koio engaged my blog copywriting services to create content marketing articles highlighting their eco-friendly manufacturing process.

The project involved interviewing the co-founder of Koio and researching modern boot manufacturing methods.

### Blog Article Writing Process

As the blog copywriter, the first step was to interview experts from Koio. I asked questions about their tanning processes and how it differs from other methods.

After the interviews, I researched leather tanning and wove together an engaging narrative of the negative impacts of unregulated tanning with detailed information about Koio's cleaner, safer methods.
