Menswear influencer Stridewise engaged my blog copywriting services to create an article highlighting Vietnam's unique raw denim community.

The project involved interviewing members in Ho Chi Minh City and telling the story of what being a member of this community meant to them.

### Blog Article Writing Process

As the blog copywriter, the first step was to undertake interviews with the admins of the Vietnam Raw Denim Facebook group. I asked questions about their lifestyles in Ho Chi Minh City, how they became interested in the subculture, and how they have maintained the community for such a long period.

After each informal interview, I was able to identify a hook for the blog post that gave it a unique angle and enhance the storytelling element.

This article was featured in other menswear content marketing blogs and generated significant backlinks helping Stridwise rank on Google.
