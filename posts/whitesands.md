White Sands Cove engaged my website copywriting services to revamp its client-facing website.

I created engaging website copy for booking pages, restaurants, bars, vacation rentals, and activities. The goal was to increase guest bookings and encourage visitors to experience White Sands Cove.

I implemented a "billboarding" technique to help guests find the White Sands Cove website from popular third-party booking platforms, saving the guests money and increasing direct bookings for the client.

### Vacation Rental Website Copywriting Voice & Tone

As the vacation rental website copywriter, my first step was researching the target audience, their interests, expectations, and priorities to create a compelling voice and tone for the websites.

White Sands is a part of a new trend in vacation rentals combining the freedom of a self-service rental with the amenities one would expect from a mid-market resort. The brand's philosophy is to relax, unwind, and experience Belize's 'go slow' attitude. While the website's youthful tone captures a *no-worries* attitude, it speaks to readers in the brand's straightforward, no-nonsense tone.

### Resort Marketing Support

In addition to hotel copywriting services, I delivered content writing support for the hotel and resort's restaurant menu, social media channels, and newsletters.
