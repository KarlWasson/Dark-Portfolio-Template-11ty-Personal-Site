White Sands Cove engaged my website copywriting services for the revamp of its client-facing website.

I created engaging, website copy for booking pages, restaurants, and bars, vacation rentals, and activities, increasing guest bookings and encouraging visitors to experience The White Sands Cove.

I implemented a “billboarding” technique to help guests find the White Sands Cove website from popular third-party booking platforms, saving the guests money and increasing direct bookings for the client.

### Vacation Rental Website Copywriting Voice & Tone

As the vacation rental website copywriter, my first step was to research the target audience, their interests, expectations, and priorities to create a compelling voice and tone for the websites.

White Sands is a part of a new trend in vacation rentals combining the freedom of a self-service rental with the amenities one would expect from a mid-market resort. Part of the brand's philosophy is to relax and unwind and experience the 'go slow' attitude of Belize. While the tone of the website is youthful and captures a *no worries* attitude, it speaks to readers in the brand's straight forward no-nonsense tone.

### Resort Marketing Support

In addition to hotel copywriting services, I also delivered content writing support for the hotel and resort’s restaurant menu, social media channel, and newsletters.
